The new custom state I added was called "SMALL_TALK". The state represents small talk, meaning conversing about non-task related topics. I wanted the chatbot to be able to talk about things like the weather, hobbies, current events. Things that aren't super important but keep the conversation going. The chatbot will route the user query to SMALL_TALK when the user's input is casual or light-hearted. The chatbot will aim to carry on a friendly conversation and not seek to give advice or feedback. From sending queries to the chatbot, we get engaging, but informal responses which sound like natural human conversations.
